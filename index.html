        <h2>More than a podcast show</h2>
        <p>JMBH is a podcast platform where our purpose is to share knowledge on how stress impacts the student's academic performance and let them know that there’s also a lot of students experiencing stress and they’re not alone. We want to help our target audience to be open from a different point of view of how they overcome challenges and stress in their lives.        </p>

                Stress impairs concentration, resulting in lower grades and mental health issues such as anxiety and burnout. Our research looks into the specific stressors that these students face and how they affect their academic performance. Stress management is critical for overall student well-being and creating a supportive learning environment.

              <p>
                The goal of our stream is to provide knowledge on how stress impacts the student's academic performance to our target audience which are not limited to students. The expected outcomes of our stream will be that our target audience will be open to different viewpoints, as they could deepen their understanding about our topic and we also expect that our streaming content will be interactive and engaging to our target audience, for the audience to not get bored listening to a discussion for 30 minutes.

              <p>
                We aim to create a safe space for students by creating an understanding environment in which students can share their personal experiences while discussing effective coping strategies. We hope to encourage open dialogue among students by creating a safe space free of judgment and criticism. Through this, we aspire to empower students to explore various coping strategies, share insights, and collectively work towards enhancing mental well-being within our community.

            <p>
              In a 30-minute podcast, we’ll talk with grade 10 students at Apec Schools Pateros about their experiences. We’ll discuss things like challenges they've encountered, situations they can relate to and various educational topics. Our aim is to have a short and lively conversation, exploring the complexities of student life. 
We’ll also talk about things that students may have been through, academics, ways to handle problems, most importantly how stress affects us academically. We’ll explore how school stress affects us students and check in on mental health and share easy tips for dealing with stress
